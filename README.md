# Taxi Fare Data Analysis with PySpark

This repository is dedicated to analyzing an extensive dataset of taxi fares across the USA from 2015-2016. The dataset features over 7 million records and spans more than 10 GB, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for big data processing.

## Project Overview

The focus of this project is to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of PySpark in handling large-scale datasets efficiently. We concentrate on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare data for potential future machine learning applications. This project is tailored to emphasize data processing and transformation using PySpark without integrating pandas for initial explorations or visualizations, which is often recommended but was outside the scope of this particular analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Apache Spark
- Python 3.11.9
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/302cu/pySpark-TaxiFare-Jupyter-Notebook-Analysis.git
2. Install required Python libraries:
pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib


## Usage
Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the datasets:
cd notebooks/ jupyter notebook
